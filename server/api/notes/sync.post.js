/**
 * POST /api/notes/sync — Bulk sync endpoint with soft-delete support.
 *
 * Client sends:
 *   { notes: [...], deletedClientIds: [...], lastSyncedAt: ISO_DATE | null }
 *
 * Server responds:
 *   { pushed: [...], pulled: [...], deletedClientIds: [...], syncedAt: ISO_DATE }
 *
 * Deletion strategy: soft-delete (deleted_at timestamp).
 * - Client sends deletedClientIds → server marks those as soft-deleted.
 * - Server tells client which of its notes are soft-deleted → client removes locally.
 * - Upserts skip soft-deleted notes (won't resurrect them).
 * - Pulls exclude soft-deleted notes.
